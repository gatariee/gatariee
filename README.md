I'm a cybersecurity student from Singapore, my interests are in programming, developing offensive tools, researching interesting security topics and working on cybersecurity projects.

Sometimes I document my projects, research and CTF writeups on my [gitbook](https://gatari.gitbook.io/), do take a look!
